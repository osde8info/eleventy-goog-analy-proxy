My name is Dennis Hagemeier, and I help companies make more contacts on the web. I use the entire range of online marketing, especially in the area of inbound marketing. Whether A/B tests, segment-based mailings or cross-audience push notifications - I love the technical gimmicks that lead to more conversions.

Particularly in focus: the measurability of all measures. The days of blind actionism in marketing are over. The time of web controlling and tag management has dawned.

At the same time, this website is also my playground for web design and web development.
